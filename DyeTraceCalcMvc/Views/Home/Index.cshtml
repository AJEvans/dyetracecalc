This page calculates values associated with the dispersion of a cloud of biodegradable dye as it travels through a water system; 
most notably the diffusion coefficient. It takes in values associated with concentration measurements at some 
distance downstream from the point the dye is put in. In combination with the concentration of dye appearing over time, the diffusion coefficient can 
give insights into the water system. This is important, for example, in glacial water systems where the network of internal streams  
between water on the surface and a river exiting from the front of the glacier is largely inaccessible but critical to 
glacier stability.

<h5>Troubleshooting:</h5>    
<p>
The algorithm doesn't always converge to generate results. If you get a message saying as much, try varying the 
times to reach half peak by one up or down. It won't significantly affect the result, but is usually enough to 
kick the algorithm into convergence.    
</p>

<h5>Details:</h5>
<p>
Inputs: <em>Time to reach half peak concentration</em> is the time to reach half the peak concentration value in minutes; 
<em>Time to fall back to half peak concentration</em> is the time since the start at which it falls back 
to half the peak value after the peak has passed. <em>Time increment to use in minutes</em> is the time step used 
in iterations of the calculation (see below) 
and <em>Tolerance within which no change ends calculation</em> is similar to an accuracy level &ndash; the process is based around pairs of calculations which should 
converge to a similar value, and if the two results 
fall within this tolerance range of each other the algorithm stops. Setting these two latter values low will mean the answer 
takes longer to generate but will be more accurate. In general, if unsure, leave these two parameters alone. 
<em>Distance downstream from input point</em> is the distance from the input point at which the dye concentration is measured.
</p>
<p>
Outputs: an estimate of the peak time which can be compared with field measurements for an indication of 
accuracy, and the dispersion coefficient.   
</p>
<P>
The coefficient is calculated by iteratively using times for the peak event between times one and two. 
This time is placed into the equations for dispersion, one of which has 'time one' as a constant, the 
other 'time two'. The true values of the coefficient and estimated peak time will occur when the iterated 
peak time gives the same value for the coefficient in both equations.
</P>
<P>
This is highly unlikely to occur, so, as noted above, there is a tolerance function, which is the amount the 
coefficient is allowed to vary either side of one of the equation's values before it is equal to the other's value. 
Essentially this sets the decimal places to which the coefficient is accurate.
